    Large
    terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia

    <p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a href="#">Elephantidae</a> in the
        order <a href="#">Proboscidea</a>. Three
        species are currently recognised: the <a href="#">African bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta
            africana</i>), the <a href="#">African
            forest elephant</a> (<i>L. cyclotis</i>), and the <a href="#">Asian elephant</a>
        (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered
        throughout <a href="#">sub-Saharan
            Africa</a>, <a href="#">South
            Asia</a>, and <a href="#">Southeast
            Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now
        extinct, members of the order include <a href="#">deinotheres</a>, <a href="#">gomphotheres</a>, <a
            href="#">mammoths</a>,
        and <a href="#">mastodons</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also
        called a <a href="#">proboscis</a>),
        used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a
            href="#">incisors</a> grow into tusks,
        which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear
        flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="#">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their
        great weight. African elephants have
        larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
        backs.
    </p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="#">savannahs</a>,
        forests, deserts,
        and <a href="#">marshes</a>. They prefer to stay
        near water. They are considered to be a <a href="#">keystone
            species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their
        distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="#">lions</a>, <a href="#">tigers</a>,
        <a href="#">hyenas</a>, and any <a href="#">wild dogs</a>, usually target only
        young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants
        have a <a href="#">fission–fusion
            society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows")
        tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
        related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="#">matriarch</a>,
        often the
        oldest cow.
    </p>
    <p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with
        other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a
        state of increased <a href="#">testosterone</a>
        and aggression known as <a href="#">musth</a>,
        which helps them gain <a href="#">dominance</a>
        and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on
        their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They
        communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="#">infrasound</a>, and <a href="#">seismic
            communication</a> over long distances. Elephant <a href="#">intelligence</a>
        has been compared with that of <a href="#">primates</a>
        and <a href="#">cetaceans</a>. They appear
        to have <a href="#">self-awareness</a>
        and show <a href="#">empathy</a> for dying
        or dead individuals of their kind.
    </p>
    <p>African elephants are listed as <a href="#">vulnerable</a>
        by the <a href="#">International Union for Conservation
            of Nature</a> (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="#">endangered</a>. One of
        the biggest threats to elephant
        populations is the <a href="#">ivory
            trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="#">poached</a>
        for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="#">habitat
            destruction</a> and conflicts with local people.
        Elephants are used as <a href="#">working
            animals</a> in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often
        controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a href="#">circuses</a>.
        Elephants are highly
        recognisable and have been featured in
        art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a href="#">popular culture</a>.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The word "elephant" is based on the <a href="#">Latin</a>
        <i>elephas</i> (<a href="#">genitive</a>
        <i>elephantis</i>) ("elephant"), which is the <a href="#">Latinised</a> form of the <a href="#">Greek</a> ἐλέφας
        (<i>elephas</i>) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (<i>elephantos</i>)),<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>
        probably from a non-<a href="#">Indo-European</a>
        language, likely <a href="#">Phoenician</a>.<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
        It is attested in <a href="#">Mycenaean
            Greek</a> as <i>e-re-pa</i> (genitive <i>e-re-pa-to</i>) in <a href="#">Linear B</a> syllabic
        script.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>
        As in Mycenaean Greek, <a href="#">Homer</a>
        used the Greek word to mean <a href="#">ivory</a>,
        but after the time of <a href="#">Herodotus</a>,
        it also referred to the animal.<sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup>
        The word "elephant" appears in <a href="#">Middle
            English</a> as <i>olyfaunt</i> (c.1300) and was borrowed from <a href="#">Old French</a>
        <i>oliphant</i> (12th century).<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup>
        <i><a href="#">Loxodonta</a></i>,
        the generic name for the African elephants, is Greek for "oblique-sided tooth".<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <h3>Classification,
        species and subspecies</h3>
    See also: <a href="#">List of elephant
        species
        <p>Elephants belong to the family <a href="#">Elephantidae</a>,
            the sole remaining family within the order <a href="#">Proboscidea</a> which belongs to the
            superorder <a href="#">Afrotheria</a>. Their closest
            <a href="#">extant</a> relatives are the <a href="#">sirenians</a> (<a href="#">dugongs</a>
            and <a href="#">manatees</a>) and the <a href="#">hyraxes</a>, with which they share
            the <a href="#">clade</a> <a href="#">Paenungulata</a> within
            the superorder <a href="#">Afrotheria</a>.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>
            Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade <a href="#">Tethytheria</a>.<sup><a
                    href="#">[8]</a></sup>
            Three species of elephants are recognised; the <a href="#">African
                bush elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta africana</i>) and <a href="#">forest
                elephant</a> (<i>Loxodonta cyclotis</i>) of <a href="#">sub-Saharan
                Africa</a>, and the <a href="#">Asian elephant</a> (<i><a href="#">Elephas</a> maximus</i>) of
            <a href="#">South</a> and <a href="#">Southeast
                Asia</a>.<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup> African
            elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two
            finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or
            level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one
            extension at the tip of the trunk. The looped ridges on the <a href="#">molars</a> are narrower
            in the Asian elephant while those of the
            African are more diamond-shaped. The Asian elephant also has <a href="#">dorsal</a>
            bumps
            on its head and some patches of <a href="#">depigmentation</a> on its skin.<sup><a href="#">[10]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>Swedish zoologist <a href="#">Carl
                Linnaeus</a> first <a href="#">described</a>
            the genus <i>Elephas</i> and an elephant from <a href="#">Sri Lanka</a> (then known as Ceylon) under
            the <a href="#">binomial</a> <i>Elephas maximus</i> in 1758.<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup>
            In 1798, <a href="#">Georges
                Cuvier</a> classified the <a href="#">Indian
                elephant</a> under the binomial <i>Elephas indicus</i>.<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup>
            Dutch
            zoologist <a href="#">Coenraad
                Jacob Temminck</a> described the <a href="#">Sumatran elephant</a> in 1847 under the binomial
            <i>Elephas
                sumatranus</i>.<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup>
            English zoologist <a href="#">Frederick
                Nutter Chasen</a> classified all three as <a href="#">subspecies</a> of the Asian elephant in
            1940.<sup><a href="#">[14]</a></sup>
            Asian
            elephants vary geographically in their colour and amount of depigmentation. The <a href="#">Sri
                Lankan
                elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus maximus</i>)
            inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant (<i>E.&nbsp;m.&nbsp;indicus</i>) is native to mainland
            Asia (on the <a href="#">Indian
                subcontinent</a> and <a href="#">Indochina</a>),
            and the Sumatran elephant (<i>E.&nbsp;m.&nbsp;sumatranus</i>) is found in Sumatra.<sup><a
                    href="#">[10]</a></sup>
            One disputed subspecies, the <a href="#">Borneo
                elephant</a>, lives in northern <a href="#">Borneo</a>
            and is smaller than all the other subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter
            tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist <a href="#">Paules Edward
                Pieris
                Deraniyagala</a> described it in 1950 under the <a href="#">trinomial</a> <i>Elephas maximus
                borneensis</i>, taking as
            his <a href="#">type</a> an
            illustration in <i><a href="#">National Geographic</a></i>.<sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup>
            It was subsequently subsumed under either <i>E.&nbsp;m.&nbsp;indicus</i> or
            <i>E.&nbsp;m.&nbsp;sumatranus</i>.
            Results of a 2003 <a href="#">genetic
                analysis</a> indicate its ancestors <a href="#">separated</a> from the mainland population about
            300,000&nbsp;years ago.<sup><a href="#">[16]</a></sup>
            A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought
            there before 1521 by the <a href="#">Sultan
                of Sulu</a> from <a href="#">Java</a>, where
            elephants are now extinct.<sup><a href="#">[15]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>The <a href="#">African
                elephant</a> was first named by German naturalist <a href="#">Johann Friedrich Blumenbach</a> in
            1797 as <i>Elephas
                africanus</i>.<sup><a href="#">[17]</a></sup>
            The genus <i>Loxodonta</i> was named by <a href="#">Frédéric
                Cuvier</a> in 1825.<sup><a href="#">[18]</a></sup> Cuvier
            spelled it <i>Loxodonte,</i> but in 1827 an anonymous author <a href="#">romanised</a> the
            spelling to <i>Loxodonta<sup><a href="#">[19]</a></sup></i>; the
            <a href="#">International
                Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> recognises this as the proper authority.<sup><a
                    href="#">[9]</a></sup>
            In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by <a href="#">Henry
                Fairfield Osborn</a>,<sup><a href="#">[20]</a></sup> but
            further
            morphological data has reduced the number of classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two
            were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant (<i>L.&nbsp;a.&nbsp;africana</i>) and the forest
            elephant (<i>L.&nbsp;a.&nbsp;cyclotis</i>),<sup><a href="#">[21]</a></sup>
            the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist <a href="#">Paul Matschie</a>.<sup><a
                    href="#">[22]</a></sup>
            Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush
            elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of <a href="#">western</a> and <a href="#">Central
                Africa</a>.<sup><a href="#">[23]</a></sup> A
            2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species (<i>L.&nbsp;africana</i>
            and <i>L.&nbsp;cyclotis</i> respectively) based on differences in skull morphology.<sup><a
                    href="#">[24]</a></sup>
            DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species<sup><a
                    href="#">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[26]</a></sup>
            while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species.<sup><a
                    href="#">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[28]</a></sup>
            Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status
            as separate species.<sup><a href="#">[29]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[30]</a></sup><sup><a
                    href="#">[31]</a></sup>
            The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago<sup><a href="#">[32]</a></sup>
            and have been
            completely genetically isolated for the past 500,000 years.<sup><a href="#">[33]</a></sup>
            In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that <i>L. cyclotis</i> is more closely related to the
            extinct <i><a href="#">Palaeoloxodon antiquus</a></i>, than it is to <i>L.
                africana,</i> possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole.<sup><a href="#">[34]</a></sup>
            Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species,<sup><a
                    href="#">[35]</a></sup>
            although this is disputed.<sup><a href="#">[28]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[30]</a></sup>
            The <a href="#">pygmy
                elephants</a> of the <a href="#">Congo
                Basin</a>, which have been suggested to be a separate species (<i>Loxodonta pumilio</i>)
            are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental
            conditions.<sup><a href="#">[36]</a></sup>
