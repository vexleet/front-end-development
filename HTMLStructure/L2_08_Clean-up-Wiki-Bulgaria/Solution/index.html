            <i><i lang="bg-Latn">Bǎlgariya</i></i>), officially the
            <b>Republic of
                Bulgaria</b> (Bulgarian: Република България, <small>tr.</small> <i><i lang="bg-Latn">Republika
                    Bǎlgariya</i></i>,
            <small>IPA:&nbsp;</small><a href="#">[rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ]</a>), is a
            country
            in <a href="#">Southeast
                Europe</a>. It is bordered by <a href="#">Romania</a> to the north, <a href="#">Serbia</a>
            and <a href="#">Macedonia</a> to the west, <a href="#">Greece</a> and <a href="#">Turkey</a> to
            the south, and the
            <a href="#">Black Sea</a> to the east.
            The
            capital and largest city is <a href="#">Sofia</a>;
            other major cities are <a href="#">Plov</a>,
            <a href="#">Varna</a> and <a href="#">Burgas</a>. With a territory of
            110,994 square kilometres (42,855&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), Bulgaria is Europe's <a href="#">16th-largest
                country</a>.
    </p>
    <p>One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a href="#">Neolithic</a> <a
            href="#">Karanovo
            culture</a>, which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a
        battleground for <a href="#">Thracians</a>,
        <a href="#">Persians</a>,
        <a href="#">Celts</a> and <a href="#">ancient
            Macedonians</a>; stability came when the <a href="#">Roman Empire</a>
        conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman, or
        Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading <a href="#">Bulgar</a> horde in
        the late
        7th
        century. The Bulgars founded the <a href="#">First Bulgarian Empire</a> in AD 681, which
        dominated most of
        the
        <a href="#">Balkans</a> and significantly
        influenced <a href="#">Slavic</a> cultures by
        developing the <a href="#">Cyrillic script</a>. This state lasted until the early 11th century,
        when Byzantine emperor <a href="#">Basil
            II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a <a href="#">Second
            Bulgarian Empire</a>, which reached its apex under <a href="#">Ivan
            Asen II</a> (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second
        Bulgarian
        Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under <a href="#">Ottoman</a> rule
        for
        nearly five centuries.
    </p>
    <p>The <a href="#">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a>
        resulted in the formation
        of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its
        borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both
        world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a <a href="#">one-party socialist state</a> and part of the
        Soviet-led <a href="#">Eastern
            Bloc</a>. The ruling <a href="#">Communist Party</a> gave up its monopoly on power after
        the <a href="#">revolutions
            of 1989</a> and allowed <a href="#">multi-party</a> elections. Bulgaria then
        transitioned into a <a href="#">democracy</a> and a
        market-based economy.
    </p>
    <p>Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the <a href="#">sovereign
            state</a>
        has been a <a href="#">unitary</a>
        <a href="#">parliamentary republic</a> with a high degree of political,
        administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million lives mainly in
        Sofia
        and the capital cities of the <a href="#">27 provinces</a>, and the country has suffered
        significant
        demographic decline since the late 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>Bulgaria is a member of the <a href="#">European Union</a>, <a href="#">NATO</a>, and the <a href="#">Council of
            Europe</a>; it is a founding state of the <a href="#">Organization for
            Security and
            Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the <a href="#">UN
            Security Council</a> three times. Its <a href="#">market
            economy</a> is
        part of the <a href="#">European Single Market</a> and mostly relies on services,
        followed by industry—especially machine building and mining—and agriculture. <a href="#">Widespread
            corruption</a> is a major socioeconomic issue.
